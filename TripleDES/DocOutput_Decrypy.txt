Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.
The world has kissed my soul with its pain, asking for its return in songs.
Eyes are raining for her，heart is holding umbrella for her，this is love。
The waterfall sing, "I find my song, when I find my freedom.
If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars.It is the tears of the earth that keep here smiles in bloom.
The furthest distance in the world Is not between life and death But when I stand in front of you Yet you don t know that I love you.
Like the meeting of the seagulls and the waves we meet and come near.The seagulls fly off, the waves roll away and we depart.
